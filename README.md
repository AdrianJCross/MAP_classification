Two Category Classification Using Baysian Decision Rule

Description:
 This project designs a decision rule on a synthetic data set with two categories assuming the probability density is Gaussian. The maximum likelihood estimation is used to estimate the parameters of the Gaussian then three MAP methods are used to derive the decision rules.

Prerequisites:
Jupyter-lab
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib

Running:
Run using jupyter-lab software.
run_MAP runs the three MAP classification methods for single gaussian model
run_MAP runs the three MAP classification methods for double gaussian model
